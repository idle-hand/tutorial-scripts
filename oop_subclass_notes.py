##-------------------------------------------------------
##To use inheritance we specify the base class names in a tuple following the class
##name in the class definition. Base class is SchoolMember in this example.
##The __init__ method of the base class is explicity called using the self variable so
##that we initialize the base class part of the object.
##

##important because we are defining an __init__ method in the subclasses
##Teacher and Student - Python does not automatically call the constructor of
##the base class SchoolMember - you have to explicity call it yourself.
